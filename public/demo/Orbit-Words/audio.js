// Pronunciation: every word has a recording in Microsoft's neural voice
// (data/audio, en-US Jenny), played through Web Audio in iOS's "ambient"
// audio session: it mixes with whatever is playing (music goes on) and is
// never the phone's Now Playing (no player on the Dynamic Island or the lock
// screen), as a game's sounds. (An <audio> element took the phone's audio
// over: music stopped, and the clip showed as Now Playing.) Like any ambient
// sound, the ring/silent switch silences it. The context is woken in the tap
// that asks for a word (iOS starts sound only from a tap), and stays awake,
// so later words play from code too. Without the clip (offline, a missing
// file, no Web Audio): the device's best English voice (lib/voice.mjs).
// The speed is the person's (state.opt.rate, 0.75 to 1.25).
