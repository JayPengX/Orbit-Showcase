// Words: the high-school English reference list (大考中心, 108 curriculum),
// levels 1 to 6, and how Orbit Words teaches them. Pure functions (no DOM),
// so they're tested directly.
//
// Learning is meant to be hard, because what's hard to recall is what's
// remembered ("desirable difficulty"):
//   - Every wrong option is the one most likely to be picked by mistake: a
//     word spelt almost the same (adapt / adopt / adept), one that means
//     something close (能力 / 才能), the same part of speech and shape, and
//     above all a word this person has already mixed this one up with
//     (`distractors`). Two options are never both right.
//   - Each word is asked in a way it's ready for, and a round mixes every
//     way: recognising it (English to meaning, meaning to English, by ear)
//     and producing it (unscrambling, filling in its missing letters,
//     dictation), producing more the better it's known (`smartType`).
//   - A memory model per word (`grade`, FSRS, the scheduler Anki uses): how
//     long it stays remembered (stability, in days) and how hard it is for
//     this person (difficulty, 1 to 10). A word comes back when the chance
//     of still knowing it falls to 90%. Recalling it late in that time
//     counts more than recalling it fresh; writing it counts more than
//     picking it; a quick answer more than a slow one; missing it cuts its
//     stability and makes it harder for good.
//   - The list is long (some 3,000 words in levels 4 to 6 alone), so time
//     goes to what isn't known yet. A new word's first question in a round
//     is a check, a cloze that's hard to guess: right without hesitating, it's
//     known and out of the way for weeks after one question (`grade`'s
//     `check`); only what's missed is learnt. Words easy for this person come
//     back later (at 80% recall, not 90%), and a round leads with the weak
//     ones: missed, slipping, hard.
//   - A round leads with the weakest due words (the likeliest forgotten, and
//     the hard and slipping before the easy), adds the words they were
//     confused with, keeps confusable words apart, and adds new words only
//     while the words still being learnt are few enough to hold (`pickRound`).
//   - New words can be studied first, as cards (`toStudy`): a batch of them,
//     then a quiz on just that batch.
//   - The model fits this person (`personalFactor`): FSRS's numbers are an
//     average learner's. Every review a day or more after the last is kept
//     (the last 300), and the one factor on stability that best explains
//     what this person actually recalled is found (pulled to 1 while the
//     reviews are few). Someone who remembers better than average gets
//     longer gaps (less time on what they know), someone who forgets more,
//     shorter ones.
//   - Due dates are spread (`fuzz`): a few percent either way, the same on
//     every device, so words learnt together don't all fall due on one day.
//
// A word's progress (the payload's `w`): { s stability (days), D difficulty,
// b box (from s: 1 to 5), d due day, n answers, r right, t last answer (ms),
// m mastered once, l lapses, c [keys it was mistaken for, latest first],
// o how the last answer went (1 right, 2 missed), x [how this person
// misspelt it, latest first] }.
